hints:
This tutorial https://medium.com/@rajibrath20/the-best-way-to-map-a-onetomany-relationship-with-jpa-and-hibernate-dbbf6dba00d3
says (on one of the bottom paragraphs) that there should be no way to add a group by itself to avoid inconsistencies
(f.e. there is no volunteer with the ID with which we have just added a group-volunteer).
Instead, the User interface should provide interface to add groups.
-- TODO: check if it is possible to add a group with a primaryvolunteerid which does not exist in the Volunteer table
